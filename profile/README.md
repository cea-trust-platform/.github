# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the __CEA TRUST Platform's organization__ on Github

<font size="8"> This organization consists of several **public git repositories** </font>

## **1. TRUST code**

<font size="8"> 

**TRUST** is a thermalhydraulic software package for CFD simulations. It was originally designed for incompressible single-phase and Low Mach Number flows,
but an increasing effort is made towards simulating real compressible multi-phase flows.

This software is OpenSource (BSD license).

The public TRUST git repository is available at **https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code**
  
The public repository of the TRUST Doxygen documentation is available at **https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/TRUST_Doxygen.github.io/html/index.html**

## **2. TrioCFD code**

<font size="8">

**TrioCFD** is the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code based on the TRUST platform. The code contains Front_Tracking, Radiation, ALE for fluid/structure interactions and Turbulence LES & RANS models.

This software is OpenSource (BSD license).

The public TrioCFD git repository is available at **https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code**

## **3. ICoCo interface**

<font size="8">
  
**ICoCo** stands for Interface for Code Coupling. This is a norm that a code may choose to implement to facilitate its coupling with other ICoCo-compliant codes.

The public ICoCo git repository is available at **https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/icoco-coupling**

</font>

## **4. MEDCoupling tutorials**

<font size="8">
  
**MEDCoupling** is a powerful library that can be used to manipulate fields/data within a numerical simulation (see **https://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/dev/MEDCoupling/developer/index.html**)
  
This public repository contains some jupyter python tutorials illustrating various useful applications of MEDCoupling and is available at **https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/MEDCoupling_tutos**  

</font>

## **5. Codes R&D**

<font size="8">
  
  - **Stokes_NCFEM**
  
    Matlab code devoted for order 1 and 2 nonconforming finite elements for Stokes in 2D.
  
    The public git repository is available at **https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/Stokes_NCFEM**
  
  - **FluidDyn** 
  
    Python 1D code for multiphase flow and interface tracking.
  
    The public git repository is available at **https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/FluidDyn**
