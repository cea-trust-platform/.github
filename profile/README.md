<font size="6"> 
  
**TRUST** is a thermal-hydraulic software package for CFD simulations. It was originally designed for incompressible and Low Mach Number flows, but an increasing effort is made towards simulating real compressible multiphasic flows.

This software is OpenSource (BSD license).

The public TRUST git repository is available at: https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code

<font size="6">

**TrioCFD** is the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code based on the TRUST platform. The code contains Front_Tracking, Radiation, ALE for fluid/structure interactions and Turbulence LES & RANS models.

This software is OpenSource (BSD license).

The public TrioCFD git repository is available at: https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/TrioCFD-code

## **3. ICoCo interface**

<font size="6">
  
**ICoCo** stands for Interface for Code Coupling. This is a norm that a code may choose to implement to facilitate its coupling with other ICoCo-compliant codes.

The public ICoCo git repository is available at: https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/icoco-coupling
